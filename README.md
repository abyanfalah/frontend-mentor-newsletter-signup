## My process

### Built with

- TailwindCSS
- Mobile-first workflow
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I've been learning web backend development all this time, so frontend stuff is still a new thing to me. In this challenge i practiced mobile-frist workflow and applying responsive design, and most importantly my slicing skill is getting better. Thanks to TailwindCSS i don't have to deal with css directly.
